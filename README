Originally a simple port of LustyExplorer (vimscript #1890) to Python3.

Basic keybindings are <leader>lf to open a file with the starting directory being the current working dir, <leader>lr to do so but at the current buffer's directory and <leader>lb to access your buffers. Further bindings and instructions are found in lycosaexplorer.vim
