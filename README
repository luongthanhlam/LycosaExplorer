A port of LustyExplorer (vimscript #1890) to Python, my thanks to Stephen Bach for providing such a great script in the first place.

Basic keybindings are <leader>lf to open a file with the starting directory being the current working dir, <leader>lr to do so but at the current buffer's directory and <leader>lb to access your buffers. Further bindings and instructions are found in lycosaexplorer.vim

This project is also available on bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/mikehart/lycosaexplorer
